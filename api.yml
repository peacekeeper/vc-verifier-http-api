openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  description: This is an experimental open API specification for verifying digital credentials based on standards such as the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), JWT (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519), and Open Badges (https://openbadges.org/). Implementations are expected to change significantly and implementers that are not directly involved in the work are strongly urged to not implement this API. Implementations of this API may differ in terms of which data formats or proof formats they do or do not support. Implementations may choose to not support certain parts of this API (e.g. optional parts include retrieving a verification status that has already been created).

A default list is also expected to encapsulate all available checks. This option might be changed to a 'ignore' option where it lists the checks the developer would like to skip.
